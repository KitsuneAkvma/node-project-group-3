Welcome to the Wallet App, a collaborative project developed by a team of 5 talented individuals. In this project, I had the privilege of serving as the team leader, overseeing the development process and ensuring smooth coordination among team members. 

## Project Overview

The Wallet App is a web application designed to simplify payment management. It provides a user-friendly interface for tracking payment history, allowing users to add, delete, and edit payment records with ease. The app also features category management, enabling users to organize their payments into different categories.
